		<h1>About Seinfeld Quote</h1>
		<p class="lead">
			This site is dedicated to making it easy to find and access your
			favorite quotes from that legendary TV sitcom about nothing. You can
			search for random quotes by topic or speaker, or just get a totally
			random quote altogether.
		</p>

		<p>
			The site began its life as an
			<a href="https://github.com/jreese/supybot-plugins/tree/master/Seinfeld">IRC bot plugin</a>
			that would fetch random quotes from Seinfeld episodes based on a
			search term or phrase.  The bot would query its database for any
			spoken sentence that matched the given subject, and pick a random
			quote to return to the user, with context.  Its quote database is
			generated using
			<a href="https://github.com/colinpollock/seinfeld-scripts">scripts by Collin Pollock</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			With the <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask web framework</a>,
			<a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Twitter Bootstrap</a>,
			<a href="http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>,
			and a bit of polish, the IRC plugin was reborn as SeinfeldQuote.com,
			and a new era of quotes from a show about nothing was born.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many planned features to expand the functionality of the
			site, including more options for exploring episodes and speakers,
			getting more context when viewing quotes, and sharing your favorite
			quotes with your friends who also like shows about nothing.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <a href="https://github.com/jreese/seinfeld">source code</a>
			is open source, and welcomes bug reports, contributers and feature
			requests.  Documentation is extremely sparse at the moment, but
			should be relatively straightforward for those familiar with Flask
			and WSGI applications.
